# Python recognizing faces and movements with OpenCV

OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems.

OpenCV-Python makes use of __Numpy__, which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations with a __MATLAB-style syntax__. All the OpenCV array structures are converted -__to and from__ Numpy arrays.

OpenCV is used for all sorts of image and video analysis, like facial recognition and detection, license plate reading, photo editing, advanced robotic vision, optical character recognition, and a whole lot more. We will be working through many Python examples here.

in this repository we use the basics of OpenCV to recognize faces, people, cars...
